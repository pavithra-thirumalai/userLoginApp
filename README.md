# userLoginApp
The app performs user registration and login using reactjs in frontend and python flask
Develop a python-flask based User REST API 
1. Supports user retrieval, creation and update  2. User profile includes name, email address and telephone number 3. API follows REST standards and uses verbs like GET, PUT and POST 4. User REST API supports password based authentication 5. Uses a relational database (MySQL..) for storage 6. Passwords are encrypted in the storage 7. REST API should be self-contained and can be run in a Docker container

Develop python-flask decorator methods for authentication and authorisation  
We want to secure additional APIs based on user authentication and authorisation. Please develop a python-flask package that can be included in new services and protect the APIs.  
1. Develop decorator definitions for protecting API methods 2. Decorators should work for all REST verbs (GET, POST and PUT) 
  
Develop a ReactJS frontend UI for user creation, updates and login 
• Using User APIs, create a ReactJS frontend • Develop components for user registration and login • Use promises and error handling where required
